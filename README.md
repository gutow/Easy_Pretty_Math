# Easy_Pretty_Math
Easy way(s) to get pretty math output in Jupyter notebooks.

Definition of a wrapper function `dmo(---)` to get nice typesetting of math operations.

Overrides of sympy operations and functions to generate typesetting of math operations, not just results.

Intended mostly to aid with teaching students, who often have difficulty translating code into the symbolic math operations they are used to.

At present contains some example notebooks.
